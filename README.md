# Bionic-Hand-Control-With-EEG-Sensor

In this project, the bionic hand was designed similar to the human hand. The energy required to move the bionic hand was provided by the servo motors. Each joint of the fingers was controlled by a special mechanism using Arduino. 

Bionic hand design was done using CAD. The bionic hand was controlled by EEG signals obtained with NeuroSky MindWave.
